# ðŸš€ Google Developer Student Club Template Website
> The commitment of this repository is to allow all the Developer Student Clubs to **generate a site** for their club in **less than 3 minutes**, performing a few simple steps.<br> <br>
**The management of this site does not require any kind of web development and backend competence.**

## How can I change the content of the site without knowing web languages?
To change the content of the site, go to the `content` folder located in the root of the project. In this folder there are several .yaml files in which you can modify the contents.  <br> To modify the metadata (title, meta description, ...) in the site Metadata field of `./gatbsy-config.js`
#### Example of content/teams.yaml
```yaml
- name: John Doe
  role: Mentor
  img: images/teams/avatar.png
  descs:
    - Mobile and Web developer
    - Open source enthusiast
    - Community mentor
  social:
    twitter: https://www.example.com
    github: https://www.example.com
    linkedin: https://www.example.com
```
#### Site metadata
| name | usage |
|---|---|
| title |  Value of site `<title>` tag |
| description | Meta description  |
| header | Website header |
| lang | Lang property |
| register | Link for the "become a member" button. |
| mail | Used in footer |
| social | Social links used in footer |

Please note that the both the `mail` and the `register` fields are optional (if undefined, they won't be shown on the website)

```js
faTelegram as telegram

	github
	linkedin
	telegram
}
```
